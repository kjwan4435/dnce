          The game of chicken, also known as the hawkâ€“dove game or snowdrift
          game, is a model of conflict for two players in game theory. The
          principle of the game is that while the outcome is ideal for one
          player to yield, but the individuals try to avoid it out of pride for
          not wanting to look like a 'chicken'. So each player taunts the other
          to increase the risk of shame in yielding. However, when one player
          yields, the conflict is avoided, and the game is for the most part
          over.
